The Caprese App
====================================
Project and Pomodoro Timer...more than just a tomato timer.

Background:
The idea for the Caprese app came from my experiments with various pomodoro timer apps while working on 
the Thinkful Flexible Fullstack program.  As I worked through each section I would try to keep track of 
how much time I spend on each unit and compare it to the targeted time.  Ultimately, this proved difficult
to do and found myself wishing there was an integration between a pomodoro and a project/task timer. 
The Caprese App is the basic implementation of the functionality that I sought.

Dashboard

Below is a screenshot of the user's dashboard showing active and completed projects as well as a form for selecting
the pomodoro (work period) and break time lengths. For demonstration purposes the defaults are set to 10 seconds and 
5 seconds, respectively.
