The Caprese App Project Time Tracker
====================================
...more than just a tomato timer.
------------------------------------

Background:
The idea for the Caprese app came from my experiments with various pomodoro timer apps while working on 
the Thinkful Flexible Fullstack program.  As I worked through each section I would try to keep track of 
how much time I spend on each unit and compare it to the targeted time.  Ultimately, this proved difficult
to do and found myself wishing there was an integration between a pomodoro and a project/task timer. 

This is a basic iteration of the functionality that I sought.
